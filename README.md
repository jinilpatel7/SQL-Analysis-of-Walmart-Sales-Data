# Comprehensive SQL Analysis of Walmart Sales Data for Strategic Business Insights
I began by loading the Walmart sales data into a SQL table and enhancing the dataset by adding several columns such as:
time_of_day: Categorized as morning, afternoon, and evening based on the sales time.
day_name: The name of the day the sale occurred (e.g., Monday, Tuesday).
month_name: The name of the month the sale occurred.
Once the data was pre-processed, I explored various aspects of the dataset through targeted SQL queries to answer key business questions.

Key Insights & Outcomes:
Most Selling Product Line: I identified the product line with the highest number of sales transactions, providing a view of which category was most popular among customers.

Total Revenue by Month: Monthly revenue trends were examined, allowing you to see which months were more profitable and spot seasonal trends in sales.

Monthly COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) Values: The total COGS for each month was calculated, helping assess the overall cost of products sold each month in relation to revenue.

Revenue by Product Line: This query allowed you to break down revenue for each product line, giving insight into which products contributed most to overall sales performance.

City and Branch Revenue: Revenue per city and per store branch was evaluated, identifying high-performing regions or branches for deeper business strategy alignment.

Largest VAT by Product Line: You identified the product line that generated the most VAT (Value Added Tax), giving insights into the tax burdens associated with each product category.

Product Line Performance Rating ("Good" or "Bad"): I added a performance column to each product line, marking them as "Good" if their sales were above the average, or "Bad" if below average. This helped quickly distinguish strong performers.

Branch with Higher than Average Sales: I compared branch sales averages to the overall average, helping identify stores that outperform and could be considered for further investment or study.

Gender-Based Product Line Sales: The count of sales by gender for each product line was explored, revealing gender preferences across different categories.

Customer Type Count and Revenue: The count and revenue contribution of different customer types were analyzed, helping pinpoint the most lucrative customer segments.

Gender Distribution per Branch: I examined the gender breakdown of customers in each branch, which can help with targeted marketing strategies.

Number of Customers by Time of Day: By analyzing the number of customers during different times of the day on each weekday, I gained insight into peak times for customer traffic, helping optimize staff schedules.

Most Revenue-Generating Customer Type: I identified which customer type brought in the most revenue, providing insights into customer loyalty or sales strategy efficiency.

City with Largest VAT Percent: The city with the highest VAT percentage was found, indicating where tax burdens might be highest or sales tax rates are steeper.
